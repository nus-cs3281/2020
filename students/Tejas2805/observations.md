### Project: Oppia

Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback.

### My Contributions

I chose this project as I liked the way they interacted with the first time contributors and their response rate to PRs. They gave equal amount of importance to a first-time contributor's suggestion in comparison to a senior developer's suggestion and this was something I really appreciated.

* Did the March testing release ([Version 2.9.1](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/releases)) for Oppia

### My Observations

Working on both RepoSense and Oppia has helped me understand the difference between the scale of  the two projects and how a project's organization and management is dependent on the size of the project. It has also helped me draw key comparisons between both and how one rpoject can learn from the other.

**Suggestions for RepoSense:**

1. **Onboarding new developers**: Oppia has an onboarding team which provides first-time contributors with an onboarding mentor whose role is to guide the first-time contributor in his first contribution to the project and help them find the taks most suited to their strength.

1. **Closing of Stale PRs**: Oppia has a high response rate to PRs. As a result of this, any PR which hasn't had any activity in 7 days is marked `stale` and if there is still no activity in it, it is closed after 4 days. This keeps the issues still open for other developers to take it.

1. **Reviewing of PRs**: Oppia assings a senior developer to each PR based on the files being edited by the PR. This makes sure that the contributor keeps on getting feedback whenever they are ready or have a doubt. This also improves the reviewing pace. Once the assigned senior developer approves the PR, other senior developers review it.

**Improvements for Oppia:**

1. **Improved documentation**: Oppia uses a large number of tools to keep its project up and running; but there is not a lot of information regarding what these tools are. It also doesn't provide proper documentation regarding how to run oppia locally. Such a documentation though tedious to write down, will help developers understand what needs to be done locally.

1. **Default data**: Oppia doesn't provide default data when developers run it locally. This makes it difficult for first-time contributors to understand the project when they run it locally. RepoSense, on the other hand provides default data which helps the developer understand the purpose of each of the features and the way it is implemented up to some extent.
