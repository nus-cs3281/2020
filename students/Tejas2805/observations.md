### Project: Oppia

Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback.

### My Contributions

I chose this project as I liked the way they interacted with the first time contributors and their response rate to PRs. They gave equal amount of importance to a first-time contributor's suggestion in comparison to a senior developer's suggestion and this was something I really appreciated.

* Did the March testing release ([Version 2.9.1](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/releases) for Oppia

### My Observations

**Suggestions for RepoSense:**

1. **Onboarding new developers**: Oppia has an onboarding team which provides first-time contributors with an onboarding mentor whose role is to guide the first-time contributor in his first contribution to the project and help them find the taks most suited to their strength.

1. **Closing of Stale PRs**: Oppia has a high response rate to PRs. As a result of this, any PR which hasn't had any activity in 7 days is marked `stale` and if there is still no activity in it, it is closed after 4 days. This keeps the issues still open for other developers to take it.

1. **Reviewing of PRs**: Oppia assings a senior developer to each PR based on the files being edited by the PR. This makes sure that the contributor keeps on getting feedback whenever they are ready or have a doubt. This also improves the reviewing pace. Once the assigned senior developer approves the PR, other senior developers review it.
