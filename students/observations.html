            <h4 id="comprehensive-contributing-guide">Comprehensive contributing guide</h4>
            <p>Babel's <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing</a> guide lists all the steps needed to build and test Babel in an easy to follow manner. Also, it lists where to get help (their Slack channel), how to submit PRs, and lots of other important information.</p>
            <h4 id="poor-documentation">Poor documentation</h4>
            <p>Even big projects like Babel can be lacking in documentation. It was difficult to get started with Babel, since the project was so huge and it took many hours of trial and error to figure out where to even start. They had some small guides on their Abstract Syntax Tree and how to write plugins, but that was it. This unfortunately seems to be an issue with many projects as I faced the same difficulty when first starting out with MarkBind. Nonetheless, it would be great for these projects (and other projects too) to have better documentation. Not just so that it would be easier for new contributers like myself to submit PRs, but also for all maintainers to know why a certain thing was written that way a few years down the road.</p>
            <h4 id="precise-specification">Precise specification</h4>
            <p>In contrast with its lacking documentation (i.e. how to implement a feature), it was comparatively easy to know what that feature should do. Babel tries to implement the latest <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">ECMAScript specification</a>, and the specification provides a very detailed explanation of exactly how a language feature (e.g. default parameters) should work. This is why bugs reported in Babel can be determined to be legitimate objectively and quickly: reference the specification and that's it!</p>
            <p>This aspect is very different as compared to other compiler projects out there (inclduing MarkBind). MarkBind, React, Vue, etc are all projects where their specification is also a part of the project, and so when a legitimate bug is reported with regards to the syntax, the bug could either be a bug in the specification (but implementation correctly follows the specification), a bug in the implementation (does not correctly follow the specification), or maybe even both.</p>
            <p>Should MarkBind have a formal specification? It currently uses a mix of several different syntax, so unless a custom MarkBind parser is written we probably have no reason to do so.</p>
            <h4 id="easy-testing">Easy testing</h4>
            <p>The nature of Babel (compiling JavaScript into JavaScript) nicely gives rise to its test suite: One folder for each test, with each folder containing 2 files, <code>input.js</code> and <code>output.js</code>. <code>input.js</code> contains the code to be transpiled, and <code>output.js</code> contains the expected output. Adding and updating files are therefore really easy. Of course, there are other tests in Babel, but the one I described is the most commonly used. In a way, Babel is very similar to MarkBind, in that they are both compilers.</p>
            <p>MarkBind currently tests Markbind snippets via the use of test sites, where there are a few test sites with many <code>.md</code> files that make up a full site. Then, the expected HTML output of all these files are stored in a separate folder. This makes it hard to compare the input and output, since location-wise the source MarkBind file and the output HTML file are quite far apart. It might be feasible for us to introduce this method of testing, or even rewrite our current test suite. Then test updates would also be more modular, as all additions would be entirely confined to an new folder, resulting in easier code reviews as well!</p>
            <h4 id="easily-reproducible-bug-reports">Easily reproducible bug reports</h4>
            <p>You can easily share a code snippet on the <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl">Babel playground</a>. You can choose between many different configuration options, plugins, and versions, and also share the link to the exact state of your REPL. This makes it an ideal way to submit bug reports, where anyone can read the issue and then click on the link that reproduces the issue exactly. This would eliminate many &quot;unable to reproduce&quot; bugs in practice, since the reporter can verify bugs on the playground itself before reporting.
              MarkBind might be able to implement this to a certain degree, such as self-contained MarkBind syntax that does not reference other files. This would allow easier verification of bugs, since developers can simply click on a link and see the bug in action instead of having to copy the offending code over and then building the site. However, we wouldn't be able to call this a true &quot;MarkBind playground&quot; since it does not include all features of MarkBind.</p>

                <p>The use of a <strong>sandbox environment with an intergrated editor</strong>, particulary via <a href="http://codesandbox.io">codesandbox.io</a> makes it easier to report bugs. One just needs to paste the corresponding source code, and the rendered output can be seen on the other half of the screen. Bug reporters would also give brief instructions, such as steps for reproduction or state what to focus on. The sandbox environment makes it easy for developers to see what bug is being reporting, and reproduce issues easily and quickly. It seems that for now, sandboxes in <a href="http://sandbox.io">sandbox.io</a> can be configured for popular libraries (such as Vue, React, Angular), it would be extremely nice to investigate how to configure one for MarkBind. Be it by talking to the developers of <a href="http://codesandbox.io">codesandbox.io</a> or by building our own code playground ourselves.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Writing documentation comments on the attributes in javascript comment (in React terms, <code>props</code>), <strong>automatically generates documentation</strong> in the form of a table. This is acheived via the use of a <a href="https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap/blob/master/www/src/components/ComponentApi.js">function/component</a> they made themselves. This makes the documentation and code always in sync, and also decreasing the number of places to update from the 2 places (the code, and the docs), to just 1 place (the code). This is easy for the project to implement because each React-Bootstrap component is isolated in its own React Javascript file. The closest thing we have similar in MarkBind would be vue-strap components. Unfortunately, it seems more difficult to do the same for MarkBind syntax, especially elements that use <code>markdown-it-attrs</code>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The project encouraged <strong>Test Driven Development</strong>, which provided me a straightforward and pleasant experience when working on an enhancement. First, I add small unit test like the code block below representing my intended behavior. Then, I will code until I pass the test case. In MarkBind, I would have my own test site and add all the components and attributes I want to test for in the markdown file. While coding a feature, I would <code>serve</code> the test site and visually check if I have implemented my intended behavior. It works but is slightly a more clunky experience, and visual inspection is not always reliable. Why I did not use the existing snapshot-like testing tool MarkBind had, i.e. <code>npm run testwin</code>, is something worth further reflection/discussion with the MarkBind team. I know for sure, one thing I appreciated in React-Bootstrap, was that their <strong>testing framework gave feedback via a delightful UI</strong>, showing specific headings stating which component and what behavior is currently being tested. One could consider my observation a small nit, but in my opinion, it goes a long way in encouraging test driven development.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Public communication channels</strong> are important for both users and developers of open source libraries. React-Bootstrap has a public Discord as an open channel for contributors, new and old, to come and discuss, or ask quick questions, regarding the project/workflow. I learnt from one of the maintainers in the channel that discussions over the project take place both in Github issues as well as in the Discord channel. To my knowledge, MarkBind has a Slack, but it seems to be invite only. Should MarkBind want to open up to public contributors, it should consider providing and promoting a public channel as well. When it comes to usage of the library, React-Bootstrap directs such questions to Stack Overflow with questions tagged <code>react-bootstrap</code>, or a different channel in their Discord suited for &quot;How do I use X&quot; type of queries.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Code coverage</strong> is a major issue for the project, starting June 11 2019 and almost completed. To organise efforts to increase the coverage of tests, a central hub was created in the form of a pinned Github issue. In it, was a checkbox list of links to a code coverage site (<a href="http://codecov.io">codecov.io</a>) that detailed coverage per file, mostly those of the major components. From that page, interested contributors can indicate their interest to add tests for a specific component, preventing contributors from doing overlapping work.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The use of <strong>Prettier</strong> reduced the possibiliy of dealing with coding style nits, both as a contributor as well as a reviewer. Speeding the time taken to have a successful PR. Which can and had been suggested for MarkBind before.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>These two observations are things worth taking note when a library/project matures. One of the issue raised was regarding adding <strong>blog for future releases</strong>, which is useful for users of the library to reference to when migrating to a newer release. MarkBind is still relatively young. But in the far future, when we might go to v3, we need to take not of having a point of reference for migrators. Another issue raised asked <strong>what organisations are using React-Bootstrap</strong>. Even though React-Bootstrap is <code>Used by</code> 198172 repos, even such a widely use library does not know if it's used by any major organisation. Unfortunately, only 2 organisations replied to that issue, which is now buried past the first page of issues.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>React-Bootstrap has a <strong>repo of examples</strong>. Which is useful for users to reference to. Beyond the 2 templates for Markbind, we can consider adding templates showing more in depth usage, or suited to a particular use case. For example, a 'portfolio site' template, or a 'module site' template.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Lack of Triaging is not the end of the world</strong> to a project. While exploring projects before React-Bootstrap, I realised that even the <code>good first issue</code> label isn't exactly useful. If anything, it's rarely utilised effectively/appropriately in most projects I've seen, or very quickly taken up. From my observations, if you have active maintainers commenting on issues, it does alot to encourage new contributors to take up tickets. There are better way to judge whether a project is in good health, such as by seeing that new PRs are merged to close to a day to day basis, as opposed to how colorful their issues are labelled.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>My contributions for the project starts off with mainly bug fixes (PR 1 &amp; 2) to ease my understanding to the large existing codebase. After having a deeper understanding of the existing codebase, I added some new features (PR 3 and 4) that provide more value and simplifies the effort of the user.</p>
            <h3 id="my-observations-11">My Observations<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-observations-11"></a></h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Motivation for new contributors</strong>. OpenRefine provides a good starting point for new contributors in the form of their <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribution Guidelines</a>. The guidelines cover multiple ways to contribute (in the form of PRs, feature requests, bug reports, documentation) as well as things to take note before contributing. Several first timer issues and second timer issues were also offered to ensure that new contributors can ease their way through the codebase with simple features/fixes.</li>
              <li><strong>Having good documentation is crucial for developers to get started with the project</strong>. Initially it was very daunting for me to start working on such as large codebase that are built with some technologies that I was not familiar with. OpenRefine's developer guide did not help me much either, as it only describes the application architecture on a high level, the content was not structured well, there's even missing info about several components. I had to take quite some time and dive deep into the code to figure out how the components tie with one another.</li>
              <li><strong>Specific issue templates</strong>. The issue templates have clear and concise structure which allows the developers to know all information about the bug/feature requests. This reduces potential confusion and the need to clarify and ask for more information, while forcing contributors to be more clear and specific when describing the issue. Issue templates are not set up on RepoSense and I believe it will greatly improve the quality of our submitted issues.</li>
              <li><strong>Every feature addition requires multiple tests to go with it</strong>. This is because OpenRefine's code coverage is rather low and having a higher coverage will increase the confidence in thoroughness of testing.</li>
              <li><strong>Support for multiple languages is important</strong>. OpenRefine is available in more than 15 languages. The front-end of the application is localized using the <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.i18n">Wikimedia's jquery-i18n plugin</a>. This is done to accommodate with the wide range of users that OpenRefine has. So whenever adding a new feature involves displaying texts, the corresponding translation for the other languages should also be added.</li>
              <li><strong>Good and effective code reviews</strong>. Even though OpenRefine has only two active reviewers, they keep up with the pull requests very efficiently and will review usually in a day or two. The code reviews that I have gotten were complete, clear and concise. The reviewers know that I'm a new contributor and thus providing more information about how a certain component works while correcting some mistakes in my solution. The code reviews are also done in a positive, motivating tone which really helps new contributors to feel less daunting.</li>

            <p>The following are my merged PRs for Video Hub App:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/pull/334">[#332] Fix bug of tags that persists after switching hubs</a></li>

            </ol>
            <p>My contributions for the project mainly consists of fixing and detecting bugs that exist in the application.</p>
            <h3 id="my-observations-12">My Observations<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-observations-12"></a></h3>
            <p>Video Hub App is a rather small and new application, with only two active developers working on features while other small bug fixes/features are open to external contributors.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Simple contribution guidelines</strong>. There's no format or procedures to follow in order to contribute to the project, there are no code styles to follow as well. I think it is fine at this stage, but I think in the future when the codebase increases in size, there needs to be a certain code style to follow so that code consistency is achieved, which makes code check ins and reviews easier.</li>
              <li><strong>There's no developer guide</strong>. This is perhaps due to the developers not having enough time to document their work, as I believe they are focused on churning out as much features as possible in a short amount of time. However, this decreases the willingness of external contributors to contribute to the project, as they would not know where and how to start working on the existing codebase.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="suggestions-for-internal-project">Suggestions for Internal Project<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#suggestions-for-internal-project"></a></h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Can consider to set up issue templates</strong>. It is common that contributors who submitted issues without providing full information. Issue templates allows contributors to submit their issues in a systematic and specific way, while helping to save the time and effort for developers to clarify about the issue.</li>
              <li><strong>Provide more first timer issues</strong>. There are existing first timer issues in RepoSense, but those are mainly targeted towards the back end of the application. Perhaps we can provide more first timer issues targeted towards the front end of the application, since the front end part was the harder part to grasp. This will invite more external contributors to work on the front end of the application, easing their way towards understanding how the front end ties together.</li>
              <li><strong>Can include more people in the level 2 reviewers</strong>. The number of pull requests are increasing constantly, while the reviewing progress of the stage 2 reviewers are slightly behind. Perhaps we can include current students/developers as stage 2 reviewers.</li>
              <li><strong>User Interface changes should be decided before starting to work on them</strong>. There are a lot of instances where developers contribute PRs that involves UI addition/changes, but require multiple changes due to opinions of different reviewers. This causes a lot of unnecessary rework and effort. Perhaps we can have a discussion in the issue on the UI changes, stating the reasons why the UI should be implemented in this way etc. Once we have a general consensus, the need to change the implementation of UI would be less likely.</li>
              <li><strong>Utilise Github Actions for general housekeeping tasks</strong>. Currently, we are manually doing housekeeping tasks such as reminding contributors to follow our contributing guidelines, fixing the CI checks before continuing, reminding contributors about their stale PRs etc. These housekeeping tasks can be automated using Github Actions, so that us developers can focus on solely reviewing the code.</li>
              <li><strong>RepoSense requires more robust front end tests</strong>. There were a lot of merged PRs that caused regressions in the front end of the RepoSense dashboard. A big part of this is due to our front end tests not being robust enough.</li>

              <li>D3 uses modules, but other ES6 features (e.g. <code>**</code> for exponentiation) are not widely used in older code – the project started before ES6 came out. There is no style guide on this matter; seeing that d3-random did not heavily use ES6, I stuck to ES5 when writing the pull request for it, and Bostock did not mind.</li>

            <h4 id="enhancement-csrf-token-regeneration-in-http-manual-resend">Enhancement: CSRF Token Regeneration in HTTP Manual Resend</h4>
            <p>I added a button to the HTTP manual resend screen in ZAP core to enable regeneration of the Anti-CSRF token if any were present. This addition was difficult as it involved code from the UI all the way to the HTTP APIs. Furthermore, extensive research on Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and their protection mechanisms was required to understand how to regenerate anti-csrf tokens and inject them into the HTTP request to be sent out.</p>

            <p>I added a new passive scan rule to ZAP which would allow for the scanning of HTML and javascript responses to look for dangerous JS functions that could leave a web application vulnerable. The implementation for this was particularly difficult as the senior developers suggested I support a custom payload so that users can define their own functions to look for at runtime. On top of learning how HTML/JS is structured for effective scanning, I had to learn how to utilise a custom extension and manage dependencies in gradle.</p>

            <p>ZAP has extensive documentation on contribution and development guidelines. In brief, they follow a forking workflow similar to most OSS projects, and require that PRs made be associated with issues raised. There was also a very useful blog post series outlining in detail how one can start contributing to ZAP.</p>

            <h4 id="important-lessons-learned">Important Lessons Learned</h4>
            <p>I chose ZAP as my external project so that I could begin to develop expertise in both <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Computer Security</strong>. I learned a lot about functional interfaces, callback patterns, and method forwarding in Java. I also learned in greater depth how UI design and implementation is done in Java swing. One interesting lesson was how to operate multiple repositories in one workspace on IntelliJ. Since my external project had different git repositories interacting with each other, learning how to work with multiple modules using gradle was quite enlightening.</p>
            <p>Equally as important was the knowledge I gained about web application security. The contributions I made to ZAP were highly non-trivial and required extensive research into security concepts. I learned a lot about the CSRF attack as well as professional defences against it in great detail. I was also exposed to a lot of application security concepts in breadth and have a much better appreciation for the topic now, with a firm grasp of the jargon involved.</p>
            <p>Additionally, one of the most important lessons for me was learning how to ask for help. This was the first time I had to work on such a complex project that I couldn't easily understand how things worked. Learning to ask the right questions and getting over the fact that you just had no idea what was going on was a very humbling experience.</p>
            <h4 id="suggestions-for-internal-project-2">Suggestions for Internal Project</h4>
            <p>Currently, TEAMMATES requires a review from a &quot;junior&quot; developer followed by a review by a senior developer for PR merging or approval. In that sense, there exists two teams of starkly different authority over the application. The current two-tier structure limits the availability of developers with the capacity to deal with issues like stale PRs or design conflicts, and furthermore restricts the agency of the junior developer which consequently carries the potential to disincentivise them from further involvement.</p>
            <p>One interesting practice of the external project that I feel could be adopted by TEAMMATES was the relatively flat maintainer hierarchy approach to resolving PRs and issues. In order to be merged, PRs in my external project required two approvals from the dev team. There only exists the one team, and two approvals from any member of the team suffices for resolving PRs. In that sense, each member of the dev team carried with them equal ownership over the project, which could be a very large motivating factor for continued involvement.</p>
            <p>My suggestion is that a similar approach be taken with TEAMMATES, where either the function of the senior dev team gets expanded to allow inclusion of some junior developers or more authority is given to the junior development team (e.g. two reviews from a junior dev is equivalent to one from a senior dev). This helps provide the agency needed to sustain involvement and subsequently grow the application. The success of an open source project relies upon the developer experience, which is directly improved with a larger pool of dedicated maintainers to attend to new contributors and triage issues.</p>
