### Project: Text-to-Image

A library for generating an image data URI representing an image containing the text of your choice.

### My Contributions

Add a synchronous variant of the library's main function.

### My Observations

The project is well documented and has a comprehensive test coverage using Jest. 

MarkBind could improve test coverage.
